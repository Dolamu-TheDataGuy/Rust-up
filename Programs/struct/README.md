# Struct in Rust

* Compound type allowing to __group together__ values of different types into a __named data structure__.

* Similar to tuples, but each value has a name so values can be accessed through this name.

* Have to be __instanciated__ with data, think of it like the struct is the __template for the instances__ you create from it.
