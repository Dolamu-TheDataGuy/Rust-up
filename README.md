# Rust-up

This repository is a map to my Rust journey. The Rust programming language is a systems programming language that is being used in diverse areas like `web development`, `network programming`, `system programming`, `game development`, and `data science backends`. Companies like `Facebook`, `Discord`, and `Amazon` are implementing Rust to enhance their software systems and improve security

### Why am I learning Rust?
<hr/>

* Rust is the fastest programming language after C.
* It has a rich type system.
* No garbage collector (faster runtime).
* Useful compiler output (I think rust has one of the best if no the best compiler system).
* It has memory safety.
* It is the most beloved programming language since 2016 according to stackoverflow
* Fast adoption in various branches.


## [https://github.com/Dolamu-TheDataGuy/Rust-up/tree/main/Programs/rust_variables](Variables in Rust)
<hr/>

*  Every variable in rust is intrinsically immutable.
*  Variables can only be used when it has been initialized.
*  Shadowing allows a variable to be re-declared in the same scope at the same time.
*  Variables are assigned using the `let` keyword.
*  Print to standard output with `print!()` or `println!()`
*  Scope of a variable defined by the block of code that is reusable.
*  Shadowing allows a variable to be re-declared in the same scope with the same name.
